
PLANNER
=======

Planning is a hierarchical problem solver consisting of an abstract and a concrete 
planner which applies learned activity schemata for problem solving.
The abstract planner first drives an abstract solution to a given task problem
by following a learned activity schema and then the concrete planner refines the
abstract solution towards a concrete solution.
