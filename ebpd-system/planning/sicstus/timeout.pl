%	This library provides a  SICStus   compatible  implementation of
%	time-outs. Unfortunately, it is not fully compatible:
%
%	    * Time is measured in wall-time instead of virtual CPU.
%
%	Virtual CPU time  is  hard   in  threaded-environments.  On most
%	systems, you probably need a thread  that measures the CPU usage
%	of the monitored thread. Unfortunately, this   does  not work on
%	MacOSX because there is (AFAIK) no   way  to get thread-specific
%	CPU statistics.
