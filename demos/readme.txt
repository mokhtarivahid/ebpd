Demonstrations include the teaching scenarios for the 'cafe' EBPD on a PR2 in 
Gazebo. The first demo shows the task one in 'ServeACoffee' demonstration in 
which the PR2 moves to south of table1 and places the picked up mug1 on placing 
area. In second demo, PR2 moves to both south and north of table1 and places 
mug1 and mug2 in goal placing areas.

Note that:
1) The videos are not annotated which we will provide fully annotated videos 
   for the final version of the paper.

2) For some reason the simulator failed to execute the last action (i.e., place 
   mug2 on north of table1)) in second scenario. We will debug the code to 
   resolve that problem and will include videos of demonstrations of the system 
   in all scenarios for the final version of the paper.
