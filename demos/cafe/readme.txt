Demonstrations include the teaching scenarios for the 'cafe' EBPD on a PR2 in 
Gazebo. The first demo shows the task one in 'ServeACoffee' demonstration in 
which the PR2 moves to the counter, picks up mug1 from the counter, moves to 
the table where a guest sits, and puts the mug1 on the table in front of the 
guest. In the second demo, PR2 picks up two mugs from the counter and moves to 
the both south and north sides of the table and puts mug1 and mug2 in the goal 
placing areas.

Note that, for some reason the simulator fails to execute the last action 
(i.e., place mug2 on north of the table) in the second demo. 


The abstract and concrete domains, experiences, learned activity schemata, 
generated scopes of applicability and problems, used in this experiment, are 
available in the 'cafe' domain.
